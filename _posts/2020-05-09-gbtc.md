# Why and how much did I buy?
I recently added ~1% GBTC to my portfolio's total value.

Why Digital Currency?
>Feds policies such as Infinite Quantitative Easing and Buying Junk etc during this Pandemic and stocks seem to be at all time
 high even when the jobless numbers are the worst. India did currency ban overnight. China-US continue to threaten each other with
> tariffs. That said, I do not believe that Bitcoin will be used as an every day currency but will be used more for bigger transactions
>, thus I like the name asset class.


Why Bitcoin?
It is the biggest asset class and most of the other digital currencies follow it's movement. Cathy Wood in the video below goes through a
 few more reasons to elaborate more on that.
 
 
Why GBTC and not pure Bitcoin?
From what understand the fund GBTC has a 2% management fee on top of that it sells on a premium of about 20%. Why would anyone still buy
 it instead of buying the Bitcoin itself? I think the fund guarantees the safety of the crypto keys and is completely compliant with OTC
  standards. GBTC is registered on OTCQX. I personally believe security of the key makes it all worth it.
