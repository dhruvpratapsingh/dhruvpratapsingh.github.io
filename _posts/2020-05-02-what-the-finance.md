## Introduction
I work in finance and after my work I spend atleast couple of hours reading about finance, It's a passion for me and I keep learning
 something new every day. Recently, I decided to start writing about it and get thoughts from other people. 
 
 For me it all started with my internship at Aon, when I was done with my internship, my boss gave me a book to read... *"Rich Dad
 , PoorDad"*. It was about 6 years ago and in these last few years I have learned so much about how the money works.
