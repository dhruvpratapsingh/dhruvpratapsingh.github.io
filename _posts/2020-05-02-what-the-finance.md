## Introduction
I work in finance and after my work I spend atleast couple of hours reading about finance, It's a passion for me and I keep learning
 something new every day. Recently, I decided to start writing about it and get thoughts from other people. 
 
 For me it all started with my internship at Aon, when I was done with my internship, my boss gave me a book to read... [Rich Dad
 , Poor Dad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019OVZCS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0019OVZCS&linkCode=as2&tag=dpsai-20&linkId=2152a181b1b9bed649734185c5bc8d9f). It was about 6 years ago and in these last few years I have learned so much about how the money works.
 
 In this financial series I will talk about Retirement, Equities, AI in Finance. Don't be surprised when quote my favs like *Chamath
  Palihapitiya* & *Ray Dalio*.
 
 
## Managing My Finance

### **Step 1: What is money and how economy works?**
Why the heck? What is money and how the economy works?

I think Ray Dalio can explain this 10x better than I might be able to. Here we go.

</p>

### **Step 2: How I grew up to care?**
I graduated from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities with BS in Electrical Engineering and a student loan of $105k+ at an APY of 14%(Plus
 all kinds of fees as my loan was through an Indian bank). To put that into perspective, I was paying more $15k every year just in
  interest. Luckily, I understood very well that I had to get my sh** together or our house and land that was used as
    collateral for mortgage(Yes, even the education loans need to be given with collateral) will be foreclosed by the bank.
    
I worked hard, saved every penny until it hurts. I was driving a 1997(~20 year old when I bought it) and doing my own oil changes fixing
 the fan when by myself when it broke in dead winter and the temperature outside was -30 degrees as I did not have a house or a garage to
  do that. Lived on a $20 weekly grocery budget, shared a 2bed apartment with 2 other friends of mine(wonderful people btw). After 3.5
   years, I was able to pay the loans completely. AND I WAS PROUD, so proud that I bought a Harley Davidson V-Rod for about 15k, what a
    stupid decision, I know. But it felt good and I think it was a good lesson to understand what is a "DEPRECIATING ASSET".
    
My friend at work at that time introduced me to a guy named "Dave Ramsey". I watched a couple of his videos on Youtube and totally fell
 in love with his strategy in life: Be a Banker and Not a Borrower! I think his exact quote was: "If you see me at a bank, I am there to
  buy it". Magical, ab-so-f****-lutely life changing.

"Debt is Dumb": is more of psychological approach rather than a mathematical one.

Fast Forward: My current investment strategies.

### **Retirement:**

Remember the phrase: **"Match before Roth, Roth before Traditional"**
I match my work 401k match and put the remaining money into Roth IRA using Fidelity. Once the Roth IRA is maxed out, I try to max out
 my 401k(so far haven't been able to do that, tyring none the less).

### **Individual Brokerage**
Apps: Fidelity, [Robinhood](http://join.robinhood.com/dhruvs16), M1 Finance(not anymore).

### **Investment Strategies:** 

*I am 27 Years old and can afford to be a little stupid at times.*

Below strategy of mine is solely based on my trust in American Economy.

 * Plan A: Buy SPY, IVV, VOO
 * Plan B: When the Market is down about 10%: Use the Margin @ <= 5% APY (no more than 3 months of savings) to invest in SPY.
 * Plan C: If the Market is down more than 30%: I go all in with leveraged ETFs(SPXL, SOXL, UPRO, TQQQ etc...) or options. This is a very
 high
 risk
 investment, I never do this with my retirement.
 
It has worked out very well for me thus far(might change in future as the markets evolve).
