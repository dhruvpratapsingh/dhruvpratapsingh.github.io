Before we start digging into the fundamentals of Deep Learning, let's setup the our toolset.

1. [Google Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com/) : You can run your code on GPUs hosted by Google for free.
2. [Seebank](https://research.google.com/seedbank/) : Collection of interactive machine learning examples for Colab or Jupyter.
3. Create a profile on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), if are not already signed up for it.

## Supervised Deep learning
*DL form where an output label exists for every input example. The labels are used to compare the output of Deep Neural Nets to the ground-truth values and minimize the cost function. Other forms of Deep learning are semi-supervised and Unsupervised.*
