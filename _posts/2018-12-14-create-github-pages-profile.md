# Summary:

1. Register a domain name.
2. Register for a Github account and configure Github pages.
3. Choose a Jekyll Theme and Setup your environment.
4. Setup Github Pages.
5. Add your Custom domain to Github Pages.

## 1. Register a your domain name. (Optional)

I like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/){:target="_blank"}
 for domain registration, they also offer FREE domain registrations for students. Check out https://nc.me/ to register your own domain name. If you are not a student you can still register for one with a small charge. You can also look at [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/){:target="_blank"}, [1&1](https://www.ionos.com/){:target="_blank"} etc...

Once you have a domain name registered jump on to the next section.


## 2. Register for a Github account.

Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} and signup if you already don't have an account. Once you are logged in, click "+" icon on the upper right corner and select "New Repository" option from the dropdown. Repository name should be "username.github.io" , username is your Github username. Proceed by clicking on "Create repository" button.

## 3. Setup Jekyll environment and deploy it to Github Pages.

This is a good and complete article to install, build and deploy your jekyll site on github.
