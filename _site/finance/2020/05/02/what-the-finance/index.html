<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I work in finance and after my work I spend atleast couple of hours reading about finance, It’s a passion for me and I keep learning
 something new every day. Recently, I decided to start writing about it and get thoughts from other people.</p>

<p>For me it all started with my internship at Aon, when I was done with my internship, my boss gave me a book to read… <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019OVZCS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0019OVZCS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dpsai-20&amp;linkId=2152a181b1b9bed649734185c5bc8d9f">Rich Dad
 , Poor Dad</a>. It was about 6 years ago and in these last few years I have learned so much about how the money works.</p>

<p>In this financial series I will talk about Retirement, Equities, AI in Finance. Don’t be surprised when quote my favs like <em>Chamath
  Palihapitiya</em> &amp; <em>Ray Dalio</em>.</p>

<h2 id="managing-my-finance">Managing My Finance</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-what-and-why">Step 1: What and Why</h3>
<p>Why the heck? What is money and how the economy works?</p>

<p>I think Ray Dalio can explain this 10x better than I might be able to. Here we go.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="step-2-how">Step 2: How</h3>
<p>I graduated from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities with BS in Electrical Engineering and a student loan of $105k+ at an APY of 14%(Plus
 all kinds of fees as my loan was through an Indian bank). To put that into perspective, I was paying more $15k every year just in
  interest. Luckily, I understood very well that I had to get my sh** together or our house and land that was used as
    collateral for mortgage(Yes, even the education loans need to be given with collateral) will be foreclosed by the bank.</p>

<p>I worked hard, saved every penny until it hurts. I was driving a 1997(~20 year old when I bought it) and doing my own oil changes fixing
 the fan when by myself when it broke in dead winter and the temperature outside was -30 degrees as I did not have a house or a garage to
  do that. Lived on a $20 weekly grocery budget, shared a 2bed apartment with 2 other friends of mine(wonderful people btw). After 3.5
   years, I was able to pay the loans completely. AND I WAS PROUD, so proud that I bought a Harley Davidson V-Rod for about 15k, what a
    stupid decision, I know. But it felt good and I think it was a good lesson to understand what is a “DEPRECIATING ASSET”.</p>

<p>My friend at work at that time introduced me to a guy named “Dave Ramsey”. I watched a couple of his videos on Youtube and totally fell
 in love with his strategy in life: Be a Banker and Not a Borrower! I think his exact quote was: “If you see me at a bank, I am there to
  buy it”. Magical, ab-so-f<em>**</em>-lutely life changing.</p>

<p>“Debt is Dumb”: is more of psychological approach rather than a mathematical one.</p>

<p>Fast Forward: My current investment strategies.</p>

<h3 id="retirement">Retirement:</h3>

<p>Remember the phrase: <strong>“Match before Roth, Roth before Traditional”</strong>
I match my work 401k match and put the remaining money into Roth IRA using Fidelity. Once the Roth IRA is maxed out, I try to max out
 my 401k(so far haven’t been able to do that, tyring none the less).</p>

<h3 id="individual-brokerage">Individual Brokerage</h3>
<p>Apps: Fidelity, <a href="http://join.robinhood.com/dhruvs16">Robinhood</a>, M1 Finance(not anymore).</p>

<h3 id="investment-strategies-i-am-27-years-old-and-can-take-risks-higher-than-a-lot-of-people">Investment Strategies: I am 27 Years old and can take risks higher than a lot of people.</h3>

<p>Below strategy of mine is solely based on my trust in American Economy.
Plan A: Buy SPY, IVV, VOO
Plan B: When the Market is down about 10%: Use the Margin @ &lt;= 5% APY (no more than 3 months of savings) to invest in SPY.
Plan C: If the Market is down more than 30%: I go all in with leveraged ETFs(SPXL, SOXL, UPRO, TQQQ etc…) or options. This is a very high
 risk
 investment, I never do this with my retirement.</p>

<p>It has worked out very well for me thus far(might change in future as the markets evolve).</p>
