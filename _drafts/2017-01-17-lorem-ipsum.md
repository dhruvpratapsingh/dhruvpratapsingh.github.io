The term was coined in 1964 by two [Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) [CSIRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO) researchers, Isabel Joy Bear and Richard G.

In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants) during dry periods, whereupon it is [absorbed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(chemistry)) by [clay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay)-based [soils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) and [rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)).
